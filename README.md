# Nonplanar Vehicle Control
Modeling and control of vehicles on nonplanar surfaces. 

This project uses differential geometry and rigid body motion for control-oriented vehicles models, which enable existing control techniques to be applied to new and unexplored environments. 

Publications and demonstration videos below. Python scripts corresponding to publications are located under barc3d and are next to publication links.
